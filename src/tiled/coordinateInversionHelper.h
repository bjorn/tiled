/*
 * CoordinateInversionHelper.h
 * The CoordinateInversionHelper is meant to solve issue / feature request #249 "Invert Y axis option".
 * This class will be applied throughout the code whenever the coordinate of an Object or Tile should be viewed (such as in the status bar)
 * or modified (such as in the properties view). Becuase no underlying system should be changed, this class must convert the users input from
 * the inverted format to the standard to save coordinates, as well as from stansard to inverted when displaying the coordinates to the user from
 * the standard coordinate system. This class also requires access to the preferences because that of course is where the user will select whether or not
 * they would like this feature activated. The main purpose of this class is to abstract the Preferences class from all the places in code that this feature
 * will affect.
